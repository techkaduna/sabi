**Sabi** - Translate plain English to Naija pidgin
===================================================

A simple module to translate plain English to Nigerian (Naija) pidgin English.

I had been planning on writing a Python package (academic reasons) and had been researching.
Then I encountered *arrr.py* while doing some Python study - so I decided, why not? And the result? na you *SABI*.

There is the pidginUNMT project, which is more than capable for the job, but then - there's numpy and there's pandas.

*sabi - tok like sabi pesin*

Installation
------------

To install using pip, run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ pip install sabi

Usage Example
--------------

Here are some examples of how to use the `sabi` package:

- **A simple translation**

   .. code-block:: python

      from sabi import translate

      text = "Hello World"
      pidgin = translate(text)
      print(pidgin)

- **Translating from a file into another file**

   .. code-block:: python

      from sabi import Translator

      with Translator('english.txt', 'pidgin.txt', ajasa=False) as translated:
          if translated is True:
              print('Translated!')

- **Using a decorator**

   .. code-block:: python

      from sabi import translator

      @translator(ajasa=True)
      def word(text: str) -> str:
          return text

      word("How are you")

*Trivial right? Uuugh! I know.*

Command-line Usage
-------------------

After installing `sabi`, you can run it from your shell as follows:

- **Translate text**

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ sabi --oyinbo 'how are you'

   This command will translate the text *how are you* into its pidgin equivalent.

- **Translate a file**

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ sabi --long-tok english.txt --out-file pidgin.txt

   This command translates the entire file `english.txt` located in the current working directory.

- **Help text**

   To print the help text, use:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ sabi -h
      $ sabi --help

   And for a more `sabi boi` help text, use:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ sabi

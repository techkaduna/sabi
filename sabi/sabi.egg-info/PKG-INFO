Sabi - Translate plain English to Naija pidgin.
===============================================

A simple module to translate plain English to Nigerian (Naija) pidgin English.

I encountered arrr.py while doing some Python study and had been planning to write 
a python module as my final year project before then so, what a way to start. It is 
also important to mention that I drew lots of inspiration from arrr.py module.

There is the pidginUNMT project, which is more than capable for the job but then - 
there's numpy and there's pandas.
